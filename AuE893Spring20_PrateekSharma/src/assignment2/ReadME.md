Assignment 2- TurtleSim

In this assignment the turtlebot is controlled by user inputs or predefined parameters.
The scripts folder consists of three files as required in the assignment, namely-

1. circle.py- Turtlebot follows a circular trajectory. The forward velocity and angular velocity are predefined in the code.

2. square_open.py- Turtlebot makes a 2X2 square. The forward velocity is set at 0.2 and angular velocity is also set as 0.2 rad/sec. The turtle will first move straight and then take a 90 degree turn. After making the right turn the turtle will again move straight. This process will continue till the turtle has made a complete square.

3. square_closed.py- Turtlebot makes a 3X3 square taking forward velocity and angular velocity from user. In this the turtle will firstly align itself with the starting coordinate and rotate towards its next goal. Then it will ask for the linear velocity and angular velocity from the user, after that it will complete a square trajectory like the square_open.py file.

Screenshots and videos are also attached with same names. These are  saved as .rar files in the respective folders.
