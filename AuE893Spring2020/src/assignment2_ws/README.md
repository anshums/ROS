circle.py: Running the file will make the turtle run in circle. The turtle trace a circle of radius r. Depending on the linear velocity and angular velocity, it selects the center of the circle and radius.
square_openloop: Running this file will make the turtle follow a square of dimensions 2*2. However this circle will start from the coordinates (5.54, 5.54).
square_closedloop: Runnign this file will make the circle follow a square with velocity control in both angular velocity and linear velocity. However the code needs a bit of refinement.
